SQL Solution: Selecting Rows Based on Conditions

Approach:
In this solution, we aim to retrieve specific rows from a table based on certain conditions. The task is to find product IDs for products that are both low-fat and recyclable from a table named 'Products'.

Algorithm:
1. SELECT: We use the SELECT keyword to specify which columns we want to retrieve. In this case, we are interested in the 'product_id' column.

2. WHERE: We apply the WHERE clause to filter the rows based on two conditions:
   - The 'low_fats' column should have the value 'Y', indicating the product is low-fat.
   - The 'recyclable' column should also have the value 'Y', indicating the product is recyclable.

3. Logical Operator: The AND operator is used to combine these two conditions, ensuring that only products satisfying both conditions will be included in the result.

SQL Query:

SELECT
    product_id
FROM
    Products
WHERE
    low_fats = 'Y' 
    AND recyclable = 'Y';

Explanation:
- The SELECT statement specifies that we want to retrieve the 'product_id' from the 'Products' table.
- The WHERE clause filters rows based on two conditions: the 'low_fats' column equals 'Y' and the 'recyclable' column equals 'Y'.
- The AND operator ensures that both conditions must be true for a product to be included in the result.
